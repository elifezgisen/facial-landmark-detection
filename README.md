# Facial Landmark Detection

In this code, it uses the MediaPipe library to provide facial recognition and tracking functionality. It receives a real-time video stream from the webcam with OpenCV (cv2) and locates various landmarks on the face using the MediaPipe face mesh model.

The code uses a loop and continues the video stream as long as the "q" key is not pressed on the keyboard.
